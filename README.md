# Lab 2 Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor
Utilizing the figma designs in conjunctin with the developer tools proved to be very useful for the design portion. There were still tweaks that had to be made, and I had to ensure proper construction of containers in HTML, but overall I found it to be highly useful. 
I had trouble from time to time trying to get the finer details such as spacing down, because at least from what I experienced, the css generated by figma developer was not 100% spot on, at least not when I reviewed the final product with live server. 
I believe the feedback and community resources can help to become a better developer, because you get help from people who have made similar mistakes, and have had divergent learning paths out of those mistakes, which provides a wealth of knowledge to comfortably learn from.
